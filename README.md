# Restaurant Page

## This project has special significance to me since I've been planning to make a site to publish my cocktails since the beginning of my WebDev journey

## The main focus of this project is to become well versed in WebPack as well as create everything in JS to use WebPack's modular nature

### This project helped me better understand modular programming and Webpack as well as creating DOM elements only using JS. 

#### Things I plan to change

1. Add the render functions inside of header.js in their own file
2. Add a common class to all content divs so I can clear them without clearing the entire page everytime I load it.
3. Add more content so it doesn't look like 1998 google
4. Become more comforatable using Webpack, so I can create a page for every cocktail
5. Create objects to render the cocktail because the code is rudundant
